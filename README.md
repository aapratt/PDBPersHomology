This notebook computes the alpha complex and persistence barcode of proteins in the form of .PDB files. You can add your own protein structure and set various persistence parameters. I'd eventually like to go back an animate some of the alpha complexes to show birth and death times, and maybe add in other representations of persistence, such as diagrams. This was originally work for a class I took in graduate school, inspired by work of Redo of an old project where I computed the persistence diagram and alpha complex of proteins from the PDB inspired by work of Kelin Xia and Guo-Wei Wei.
